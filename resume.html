    <h2>Education</h2>

    <h3>College of Engineering, Pune</h3>
    <h4>Bachelor of Technology</h4> 
    <h4>Major: Electronics and Telecommunication, CGPA 8.79</h4>
    <h4>Minor: Computer Science</h4>

    <h2>Research Experience</h2>

    <h3>Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay</h3>
    <h4>Summer Research Intern | May - June 2019</h4>
      <p>Designed and implemented multicycle and pipeline processor for the given IITB-RISC19 Instruction Set Architecture.<br>
      The processor was implemented in Verilog on Xilinx ISE platform.</p>

    <h3>COEP Satellite Initiative Mission "COEPSAT-2"</h3>
    <h4>System Programmer - Communication Subsystem | April 2018 - May 2020</h4>
      <p>Contributed towards interfacing transceiver with the microcontroller thus improving the efficiency of
the controller <br>and establishing an important link for communication with the satellite.<br> Contributed to
the training, evaluation and inductions of new members in the team.</p>  


    <h2>Projects</h2>    
    <h3>Hardware Accelerator: Implementation of CNN on FPGA</h3>
    <p>Developing an image classifier to classify digits using Deep learning algorithm viz. CNN<br> on an FPGA owing to its ability to maximize parallelism and also to make it energy efficient.<br> Aim is to accelerate the inference phase.</p>

    <h3>IITB-RISC19 Multi-cycle and Pipeline Processor Design</h3>
    <p>Designed and implemented multicycle and pipeline processor for a given Instruction Set Architecture<br>
     using Verilog as hardware descriptive language.</p>
    
    <h3>Data Compression on FPGA</h3>
    <p>Designed and implemented data compressor on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) using Lempel Ziv Welch algorithm<br> for compressing text. I carried out the simulations on Xilinx ISE platform and used Verilog as hardware descriptive language.<br> Compression ratio of 1.5 was achieved.</p>
    
  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <h3>Reading Books</h3>
    <p>Read a lot of books, review for few of them can be found <a href="Book_Reviews">here</a></p>
